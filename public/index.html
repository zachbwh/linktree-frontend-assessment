		/* 
			This is mocking the serverside injection of style properties which are then consumed by .scss files (e.g. Link.scss)
			The idea here is related to simplicity and performance
			The developer can clearly see the styles all defined in one place

			The browser doesn't need to wait for an API request to determine how the page should be styled
			Removes the possibility of a flash of an unthemed page during loading

			This is particularly important for the following reasons:
				* Linktree users presumably are primarily on mobile
				* Mobile users are more likely to have less powerful devices
				* Mobile users are more likely to be on a cellular (slower) internet connection
			Therefore peformance considerations are even more paramount to UX and are likely to have an adverse effect on bounce rate etc

			@TODO
			Consider the injection of link data into a global js variable for similiar performance reasons
			Doing so should entirely remove one RTT from complete render time
